# Basics
1. Function - A Function is a lazily evaluated computation that synchronously returns a single value on invocation.

2. Generator - A generator is a lazily evaluated computation that synchronously returns zero to (potentially) infinite values on iteration

3. Promise - A Promise is a computation that may (or may not) eventually return a single value

4. Observable - An Observable is a lazily evaluated computation that can synchronously or asynchronously return zero to (potentially) infinite values from the time it's invoked onwards.

5. Observables are like functions with zero arguments, but generalize those to allow multiple values.

6. Subscribing to an Observable is analogous to calling a Function
